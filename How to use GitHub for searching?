How to use GitHub for searching?

Sometimes we might search to find a tool/code to use in personal or team project, find a new project to contribute to or find an experienced and mature project to learn concepts from. There is a picture showed I search some keywords. 
For the homepage, there are three immediate sections on the left. Two of these parts can help refine our search, and one gives you more information. The first shown in my example is the search type. We can use it to tell the search engine if we are looking for repositories, text in code, text in issues or a user. The next section is a language selector. This helps us sort to only projects that contain the following languages. Finally, on the left is the advanced search. We can add more detail of our search by using advanced search. And we can look through the webpage and download the project or code what we need.
